Flask-Bootstrap Changelog
=========================

The following changes are not fully backwards compatible:

3.3.0.2
-------
* New macro for pagination added (see :ref:`Pagination <pagination>`).
* New ``utils.html`` macro package added, includes message flashing,
  form-wrapped buttons and icons.
* A class ``required`` is added to wrappers when using ``quick_form()``.

3.2.0.1
-------
* JQuery major version switched from 2 to 1. Detailed information on this change can be found in the :ref:`FAQ <jquery-faq>`.

3.1.0.1
-------
* JQuery version increased to 2.1.0, html5shiv to 3.7 and respond.js to 1.4.2.

3.0.2.1
-------
* Default action for forms changed from "." to nothing.

3.0.0.1
-------
* New major upstream release (backwards incompatible!).
* Sphinx-based Documentation instead of README-file.
* No more SAMPLE_PROJECT, a new sample app has been provided.
* A lot of options are gone, their features being made obsolete, removed or
  integrated into other parts of the extension.
* A new CDN system replaced the old loading system.
* `FontAwesome`_ has been removed in favor of `Glyphicons`_ (which now comes as
  a real font as well).

2.3.2.2
-------
* html5-shim is loaded using a protocol-relative URL
* Rendering of RadioField changed (see sample app).

2.3.2.1
-------
* Slight change in versioning (dot instead of hyphen for the Flask-Bootstrap
  release).

2.3.0-2
-------
* Switched the CDN to `cdnjs <http://cdnjs.com>`_ because `netdna
  <http://bootstrapcdn.com>`_ keeps changing files around too much.
* Introduced ``BOOTSTRAP_CUSTOM_CSS`` option.

2.2.2-1
-------
* `FontAwesome`_ now version 3.0 instead of 2.0.
* The ``navbar()``-macro is gone. It was accidentally committed and never did
  anything useful, so this hopefully won't concern anyone.

2.2.1-1
-------
* `FontAwesome`_ is now supported
  as well, can also be loaded from bootstrapCDN. Set ``BOOTSTRAP_FONTAWESOME``
  to ``True`` to enable it.
* ``BOOTSTRAP_CDN_BASEURL`` is now a dictionary for multiple CDNs (i.e.
  Bootstrap, FontAwesome can use different base URLs). This will break any code
  that relied on setting ``BOOTSTRAP_CDN_BASEURL``.

2.1.1-2
-------
* There is no longer a self.app on Flask-Bootstrap. The extension can be shared
  by any number of applications using ``init_app()`` (though the old
  ``__init__()`` signature is kept for backward compatibiliy).

2.1.1-1
-------
* WTForms generated HTML code is now considered safe. This allows Flask-WTF's
  ``RecaptchaField`` to work with ``quick_form``.

2.1.0-1
-------
* New upstream release: 2.1.0.
* Changed the default version of jQuery from 1.7.2 to just 1. This means that
  the latest 1.x.x version of jQuery will be pulled.
